# Example Images Directory

To showcase how the script works, please add two images in this directory:

1. `input.jpg` - An example of a long screenshot that needs to be converted
2. `output.jpg` - A screenshot/photo of the resulting PDF showing how the content is arranged in a 2-column grid layout

This will help users understand the before/after transformation that the script performs.

## Image Guidelines

### Input Image
- Should be a long screenshot (e.g., a webpage, chat conversation, or code snippet)
- Can be in jpg, png, or any format supported by Pillow
- Should demonstrate the need for conversion (i.e., be too long for comfortable viewing)

### Output Image
- Should show how the content is split across pages in the PDF
- Should clearly demonstrate the 2-column grid layout
- Can be a screenshot of the PDF viewer showing multiple pages

# Screenshot Grid PDF Converter

A Python utility that converts long screenshots into printer-friendly A4 PDFs by splitting them into a 2-column grid layout. Perfect for converting long web pages, chat conversations, or code snippets into printable documents.

## Features

üñºÔ∏è **Smart Screenshot Processing**
- Automatically scales screenshots to fit column width
- Maintains aspect ratio for optimal readability
- Splits content into equal-height segments

üìÑ **Efficient PDF Layout**
- Arranges segments in a 2-column grid format
- Optimizes page usage (2 segments per page)
- Generates standard A4 size pages
- Preserves image quality using Lanczos resampling

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/screenshot-grid.git
cd screenshot-grid
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pillow 10.2.0 (Python Imaging Library)
- ReportLab 4.1.0 (PDF generation)

## Usage

Basic command:
```bash
python screenshot_grid.py input_image.jpg output.pdf
```

Example:
```bash
python screenshot_grid.py Screenshot.jpg output.pdf
```

The script will:
1. Read your screenshot
2. Scale it to fit the column width
3. Split it into equal segments
4. Create a PDF with segments arranged in a 2-column grid

## How It Works

### Input Processing
- Takes any image format supported by Pillow (jpg, png, etc.)
- Automatically scales the image to fit A4 column width
- Preserves aspect ratio during scaling

### Grid Layout
The script arranges the content in a 2-column grid pattern:
```
Page 1:  [Segment 1] [Segment 2]
Page 2:  [Segment 3] [Segment 4]
Page 3:  [Segment 5] [Segment 6]
...and so on
```

### Example Output
For a screenshot of dimensions 358x6381:
- Segments are created with height matching A4 page
- Content is distributed across pages in 2 columns
- Final PDF maintains readability and print quality

## Output Preview

Original screenshot dimensions will be preserved while being scaled to fit within A4 column width. For example, a screenshot of 358x6381 pixels will be:
1. Scaled to fit A4 column width
2. Split into ~7 segments
3. Arranged across 4 pages in a 2-column grid
4. Last page may contain a single segment if total is odd
